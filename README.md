This R markdown demonstrates predictive analysis for time series data. 
For this analysis we use the Bowel Cancer Screening dataset.

The data for this analysis was taken from https://www.aihw.gov.au/reports/cancer-screening/national-cancer-screening-programs-participation/data. 
A copy of that [data](https://github.com/IshK09/bowelscreening/blob/master/bowel%20screening%20data.xlsx) is also available in this repo. 

The code is located in the file [Bowel Screen Time Series.Rmd](https://github.com/IshK09/bowelscreening/blob/master/Bowel%20Screen%20Time%20Series.Rmd)

The output of the analysis is available in [Bowel-Screen-Time-Series.html](https://github.com/IshK09/bowelscreening/blob/master/Bowel-Screen-Time-Series.html)
